** 2 New Items **
Introducing the Grok item, a 1 in 10 chance of dropping from the purple ice. This is a consumable, althoguh I wouldn't recommended eating it as it gives you almost 3 hours of poison 2, and also a core crafting component for the Ice Wand.

Introducing the Ice Wand. This is a craftable tool which will upgrade ice levels. However, be careful trying to upgrade past purple ice!
